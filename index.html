						Responsible for the MOD's self-service human resources application and database, in two years I transformed this system into one that is largely self-supporting, inluding automated backups, environment refreshes, disaster recovery and server housekeeping.
					</p>

					<p>
						Also delivered secondary technical support and monitoring for ~100 other databases within the organisation.

							<p>
								In this position I was part of a two man team acting as the focal point within the MOD for the database and application infrastructure behind PeopleSoft HRMS. This system is an Oracle product which provides self-service HR administration for MOD employees, and requires 24/7 uptime. I supported the Production Environment, as well as a number of Development, Testing, Training, Sandbox and Disaster Recovery environments, spread across two geographical locations.
							</p>

							<p>
								As part of this I was required to ensure that system uptime meets an agreed SLA of 97.5%, whilst also providing 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> line support to more than 80,000 customers using the Production system, and over 100 developers and testers.
							</p>

							<p>
								I addition to this, I also administrated a number of other systems within the organisation as part of a larger team. In total this comprised ~100 databases across 14 different applications, covering Production, Testing, Development, Sandbox and Training environments.

						<h6 class="grid 1of6">Successes</h6>
						<section class="grid 5of6">
							<p>
								Taking a proactive approach to my role, and to compensate for shrinking staff levels, I automated a number of processes which had previously been carried out manually, to allow more man hours to be devoted to support of the systems. These processes included refreshes of development environments, database backups, FTP/SFTP data transfers and server housekeeping.
							</p>

							<p>
								I implemented an online password reset tool for HRMS to allow users to reset their password without needing to call the customer service helpdesk, realising a considerable cost saving thanks to the reduced number of calls.
							</p>

							<p>
								I also planned and carried out a significant upgrade to the PeopleTools software which supports HRMS - the first time that this type of upgrade had been performed within the organisation without support from external contractors.
							</p>

							<p>
								I used proactive monitoring and administration of the systems to ensure that the target of 99.5% system up-time was exceeded, demonstrating my ability to react to and resolve incidents quickly and efficiently.
